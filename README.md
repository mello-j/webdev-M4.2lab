# Project Description

This project adds structure and style for the homepage of a bird watching website. All images and content were provided. The task was to replicate a sample home page, using appropriate CSS styling, and using appropriate HTML structure to include: Header, navigation menu, main content (including text and a side bar with images), along with a footer to display the page copyright information and credits.

## Running the Website

1. To run everything you will need to Fork or Clone this repository and open in up in an IDE on your local PC or in VS Codespaces.

2. Once you have cloned the Repo, open it up in VS Code.

3. Select the index.html file from the Explorer Window.

4. Then, using the VS Code Command Palette, type: > Live Preview Start Server. If this command is not available, you may need to install the VS Code Live Preview extension.

5. This will open up a website preview within your IDE. You can also open this in an external browser if you choose, by clicking on the 3 horizontal lines icon to the top right of the preview window and selecting 'Open in Browser'.

## Sources and Credits

I used the course provided resources from this Module's read me section, and a reading from the mozilla developer documents on Flexboxes which proved extremely useful and a good refresher lesson.

## Reflection
This lab was fun, and reminded me how weak my CSS knowledge is overall. I needed a lot of resources. I knew I wanted to use a Flexbox or Grid, but completely forgot how after only using it in the final project in CS 208. I included the initial CSS reading and the CSS structure reading below, but I basically read through and referred to any of the provided resources from the README section of this Module for any guidance. While I needed references a lot more than I would like, I thought reading through the documentation provided would make it "Stick" more than googling the answer, so I'm happy to say I did not resort to Google on this assignment (and the length of time it took reflects that). 

Overall I feel a lot more comfortable with CSS in general but I'm still amazed by the sheer flexibility in CSS, there are so many ways to accomplish the same thing (although some are definitely easier than others). There is also so much to keep track of! I will add that I think what helped in this one was taking this modular approach to slowly build the whole page. I started with the body, and worked my way down each element/child element until I reached the footer. The end result is my style sheet is a lot easier to follow, and I know where to go if I need to adjust anything!
